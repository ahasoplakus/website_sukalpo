For releasing a new `{admiralvaccine}` version it must run using the latest released `{admiral}` core version, i.e., `main` branch of `{admiral}` core.\n\n## Contact\n\nWe use the following for support and communications between user and developer community:\n\n* [Slack](https://pharmaverse.slack.com/) - for informal discussions, Q&A and building our user community. If you don't have access, use this [link](https://join.slack.com/t/pharmaverse/shared_invite/zt-yv5atkr4-Np2ytJ6W_QKz_4Olo7Jo9A/) to join the pharmaverse Slack workspace\n* [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiralvaccine/issues/) - for direct feedback, enhancement requests or raising bugs\n\n\n",
