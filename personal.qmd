## About Me

I live in Hyderabad, Telangana, with my wife Amruta and our Indie pup, Disco. Originally from Kolkata, West Bengal, I spent my formative years there, though over time, I’ve also called Mumbai, Bangalore, and now Hyderabad home.

In my free time, I enjoy watching films—especially realist dramas, thrillers, and crime stories—and listening to music—mainly Indian Classical, Classic/Progressive Rock, Jazz and Soul. I’m a passionate football fan and have been a loyal supporter of Manchester United since 2003. So, if you catch me in a grumpy mood on a Monday morning, chances are United had a rough weekend.

When I can carve out a bit more time, I love going on road trips (I’ve been driving for about a year now), exploring new places—preferably those near the sea—and taking short hikes to unwind and reconnect with nature.
